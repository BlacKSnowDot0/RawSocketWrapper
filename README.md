# Raw Socket Wrapper

Raw Socket Wrapper is a Go library designed to simplify the interface for creating and manipulating raw network packets. It supports various protocols and provides utilities for packet serialization and randomization.

## Overview

The library is currently in active development, and more detailed documentation will be provided soon.

### Key Features üöÄ

- **Protocol Support**: Facilitates the creation and manipulation of TCP, UDP, and ICMP packets.
- **Packet Serialization**: Provides utilities to serialize packets for transmission.
- **Randomization Utilities**: Includes functions to generate random ports, timestamps, and byte slices for networking.

## Getting Started üö¶

To start using RawSocketWrapper in your Go projects, you'll need to install it and its dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- `github.com/google/gopacket`: A Go library for packet processing.
- `golang.org/x/sys`: Provides low-level operating system primitives.

### Installation

Install RawSocketWrapper by running:

```shell
go get github.com/XenonCommunity/RawSocketWrapper
```

### Usage
```go
import "github.com/XenonCommunity/RawSocketWrapper"
```
After installation, import the package in your Go files:
You can now use the library's functions to work with raw sockets and packets.
